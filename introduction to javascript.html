<h1>introduction to javascript</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted 
compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting 
language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web 
pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be 
used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. 
JavaScript is both imperative and declarative type of language 
.JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, 
and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control
structures, and statements.</p><p>
 Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its 
Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow 
an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to 
user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
Useful libraries for the client- side 
are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.</p><p>
 Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a 
server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to 
communicate with a database, and provide continuity of 
information from one invocation to another of the application, or 
perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which 
is the most famous these days is node.js.</p><p>
 Imperative language – In this type of language we are mostly 
concern about how it is to be done. It simply control the flow of 
computation. The procedural programming approach, object, 
oriented approach comes under this like async await we are 
thinking what it is to be done further after async call.</p><p>
 Declarative programming – In this type of language we are 
concern about how it is to be done, basically here logical 
computation require. Here main goal is to describe the desired 
result without direct dictation on how to get it like arrow functions 
do. JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways</p><p>
 Internal JS: We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by 
writing the code inside the <script> tag. The <script> tag can either 
be placed inside the <head> or the <body> tag according to the 
requirement.</p><p>
 External JS: We can write JavaScript code in other file having an 
extension.js and then link this file inside the <head> tag of the 
HTML file in which we want to add this code</p>
